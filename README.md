# NeuralNetwork

This repository includes the code for training and testing the neural networks (NNs) utilized in the research paper titled 'Quantification of Shortwave Surface Albedo Feedback using a Neural Network Approach.' It comprises two folders: one with the heuristic NN model and the other containing the global NN model. The necessary datasets can be found in the 'data/' folder, while the Python file 'my_functions.py' contains the developed functions.
